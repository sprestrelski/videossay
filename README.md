Submitted by: Samantha Prestrelski

This web app: I've just recently gotten into video essays, which are long-form, in-depth videos about a certain topic. Share your favorites!

Time spent: 10 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] **A create form that allows the user to create posts**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Users can only edit and deleted posts or delete comments by entering the secret key, which is set by the user during post creation

- [ ] Users can repost a previous post by referencing its post ID. On the post page of the new post, the referenced post is displayed and linked, creating a thread
- [ ] Users can customize the interface of the web app
- [X] Users can share and view web videos
- [ ] Users can set flags while creating a post. Then users can filter posts by flags on the home feed.
- [ ] Users can upload images directly from their local machine as an image file
